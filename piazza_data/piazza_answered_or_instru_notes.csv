39,luhiz9knbz152,['logistics'],"['logistics', 'student']",What is merge sort,What is merge sort,"['Merge sort is a sorting algorithm that uses a divide and conquer approach to sort a list of elements. It breaks down the list into smaller sublists, sorts those sublists, and then merges them back together in the correct order. The algorithm recursively divides the list in half until it reaches the base case of having lists with 0 or 1 elements, which are considered sorted. Then, it merges the sorted sublists back together to produce the final sorted list., answered by AI\n\n You can also view detail explanation in Lecture Video 12 - 26m44s: Lecture Video']"

It involves looking at each element one by one until the desired element is found or the end of the list is reached. This approach does not require the list to be sorted and has a worst-case time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list., answered by AI\n\n You can also view detail explanation in Lecture Video 12 - 2m42s: Lecture Video']"
33,luf687yrj97mc,['hw2'],"['hw2', 'student']",Time,How to time a program?,"[""To time a program accurately and focus solely on the algorithm's efficiency rather than the implementation or machine-specific factors, you can use techniques like counting operations or analyzing the program's orders of growth. By measuring how the program's runtime scales with input size, you can understand its overall performance. This approach helps in comparing different algorithms objectively and predicting how they will behave as the input size increases. It's important to avoid relying solely on timing tools that might be influenced by the specific machine or implementation details., answered by AI\n\n You can also view detail explanation in Lecture Video 11 - 3m03s: Lecture Video""]"

It is typically used to check assumptions about the state of the program at specific points, like at the beginning or end of a function. Assertions are helpful for validating inputs, checking preconditions and postconditions, and catching bugs early in the development process.

In Python, when you create a child class that inherits from a parent class, the child class can access all the data attributes and methods of the parent class. This means that the child class can reuse and extend the functionality of the parent class without duplicating code. Child classes can also add their own unique attributes and methods. Python follows a process called method resolution order to determine which class's method to use when a method is called on an object.

1,ltov6kw867w74x,[],['student'],Welcome to Piazza!,"
Piazza is a Q&A platform designed to get you great answers from classmates and instructors fast. We've put together this list of tips you might find handy as you get started:

 Ask questions!

The best way to get answers is to ask questions! Ask questions on Piazza rather than emailing your teaching staff so everyone can benefit from the response (and so you can get answers from classmates who are up as late as you are).

Edit questions and answers wiki-style.

Think of Piazza as a Q&A wiki for your class. Every question has just a single students' answer that students can edit collectively (and a single instructors’ answer for instructors).

 Add a followup to comment or ask further questions.

To comment on or ask further questions about a post, start a followup discussion. Mark it resolved when the issue has been addressed, and add any relevant information back into the Q&A above.

 Go anonymous.

Shy? No problem. You can always opt to post or edit anonymously.

 Tag your posts.

It's far more convenient to find all posts about your Homework 3 or Midterm 1 when the posts are tagged. Type a “#” before a key word to tag. Click a blue tag in a post or the question feed to filter for all posts that share that tag.

 Format code and equations.

Adding a code snippet? Click the pre or tt button in the question editor to add pre-formatted or inline teletype text. 
Mathematical equation? Click the Fx button to access the LaTeX editor to build a nicely formatted equation.

 View and download class details and resources. 

Click the Course Page button in your top bar to access the class syllabus, staff contact information, office hours details, and course resources—all in one place!
